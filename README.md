This package implements the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method for Hubbard,
and electron-phonon interactions, including both Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) style
electron-phonon coupling.

## Diff From Main Repository

This fork aims to tackle the sometimes large amounts of file I/O generated by this package. Our research group was unfortunately crashing our HPC due to large numbers of files, so this is our solution.

The only necessity for modifying your SmoQy code to work with LessIO is to create an array ahead of time to store values in, using `measurement_array = Vector{NamedTuple}(undef, N_bins)` and creating a variable `LessIO::Bool = true` which will trigger LessIO functions. These will need to be passed to a few functions as described below.

First, we want to adjust the file system accordingly. Since we don't have saved bin files anymore, we can remove most of the folder tree and just place all of our outputs in `simulation_info.datafolder`. One caveat with this is that time-displaced correlations are not currently supported for LessIO, so in the meantime we must call our modified initialization function which will only create the necessary directories for the time-displaced measurement bins.

`initialize_measurement_directories(LessIO; simulation_info = simulation_info, measurement_container = measurement_container)`

Using the `LessIO` flag in `write_measurements!()` in addition to the extra kwarg `measurement_array`, we can suppress the writing data to bin files and instead store and read it from memory in the measurements array. LessIO also removes the need for generating `model_summary.toml`, which saves an extra write and a few reads for each run.

``write_measurements!(LessIO; measurement_container = measurement_container, measurement_array = measurement_array, simulation_info = simulation_info, model_geometry = model_geometry, bin = bin, bin_size = bin_size, Δτ = Δτ,)``

And finally pass `LessIO` and `measurement_array` to `process_measurements()`

`process_measurements(LessIO, simulation_info.datafolder, N_bins, β, Lτ, model_geometry, measurement_array)`

Currently, this supports global and local statistics, and equal-time and integrated correlation functions. Time-displaced and composite correlation functions are not currently supported.
All LessIO related functions are called using Julia's multiple dispatch, so the original functions are left untouched. This means that all examples and typical SmoQy code should run as normal. Note that MPI is currently not compatible with this LessIO.

**Also, it is important to note that this is still in testing, so there is chance that results may be inaccurate in some cases.**
**We have so far seen exact matching of results for U=0 runs of the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Kagome Lattice, however there are many other untested cases.**

### To Do

- Add support for composite and time-displaced correlation functions with LessIO
- Add MPI support eventually?
- Benchmarking runtimes for LessIO vs. standard method
- Add example codes using LessIO
- Update documentation to reflect LessIO
